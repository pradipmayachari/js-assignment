    <h1>intro on available datatypes in javascript</h1>
    <pre><b>JavaScript</b> has multiple <i>data types.</i> 
        There are seven primitive data types and an object type. 
        The seven primitive types are Boolean, null, undefined, number, BigInt, string, and symbol.
        All of JavaScript’s primitive types are immutable, which means that they can’t be changed. 
        The primitive types contain values that are fixed once they’re defined. 
        The Boolean type is either true or false and represents logical entities. 
        The null type only has one value, which is null . 
        The null value means that it refers to some nonexistent or invalid object or address. 
        The undefined type is unique to JavaScript. 
        It means that a variable hasn’t been assigned any value
